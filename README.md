# Background

Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago with more than 5800 bicycles. These bicycles are geo-tracked and locked into a network of more than 500 stations. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system. The pricing plans are single-ride passes, full-day passes and annual memberships. Customers with single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. On the other hand, customers with annual memberships are called Cyclistic members.

The goal of the analysis is to identify the behavioural differences between the Cyclistic members and the Casual riders. The scope of the analysis will focus on the trip data data for both of the customer groups of the years 2020, 2021 and 2022. The final deliverable will recommend 3 suggestions to convert Casual riders into Cyclistic members.
